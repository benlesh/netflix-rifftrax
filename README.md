# RiffTrax for Netflix

A Chrome Extension for syncing up RiffTrax audio with Netflix video.

## DISCLAIMER

This project was cobbled together for Netflix Hackday on November 2, 2015. It's not really a "sanctioned" Netflix extension, and is in no
way associated with Netflix the company. Use at your own risk.

_By using this Chrome Extension you agree that you're using it at your own risk._

### Installation

1. Clone or [Download](https://github.com/blesh/netflix-rifftrax/archive/master.zip) the code from this Repository.
2. Open Chrome
3. Navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Make sure "Developer Mode" is checked.
5. Click "Load unpacked extension" and select the `app` directory from this code base. (you downloaded it in step 1)

### Usage

After you've installed the Chrome Extension:

1. Navigate to the movie you want to Riff on Netflix and start watching it.
2. Once the movie is loaded, pause it. You'll see a "RiffTrax" button on the top of the screen.
3. Press the "RiffTrax" button to open a dialog
4. Select the RiffTrax .mp3 file and click "Load"
5. Press "Play" on the movie.

Tips: 

- If the RiffTrax button doesn't appear in the corner, refresh the page. 
- If the audio is a little off, try seeking around the movie (rewind or fast-forward a little with the slider).
- A current limitation of this extension is you may have to refresh the page between movies if you want to riff multiple movies.
